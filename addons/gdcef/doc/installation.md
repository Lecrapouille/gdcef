# Compiling Chromium Embedded Framework as Godot 4.2+ GDExtension

This repository contains the source code of some C++ classes wrapping a subset
of the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Home)
API into a Godot 4.3 GDExtension which allows you to implement a web
browser for your 2D and 3D games through your gdscripts for Linux and for
Windows. We have named this CEF GDExtension `gdcef`.

This document supposes you want compile this project. Else you have prebuild
artifacts https://github.com/Lecrapouille/gdcef/releases

## Prerequisites for compiling the GDExtension

### Operating System

*IMPORTANT:* Currently this module is only working for Linux and for
Windows. Devices such as Android and IOS are not supported by CEF. This module
can be compiled for macOS but needs some modification in the code source and
extra objective C files. I do not have a MacBook full-time so I'm looking for
some MacOS developers to help me (see my branch `dev-darwin`). You can be helped
with https://github.com/CefView/CefViewCore and the
[cefsimple](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Tutorial) example
given within the CEF tarball.

### Install system packages

Install the following tools: `scons, g++, ninja, cmake, git, python3` (greater
or equal to 3.21.0). We are using C++17, but we are not using fancy C++
features, we just to use the 17 because we need `filesystem`. We are using OpenMP
by default to make soem parallel CPU task. You can disabled it for the `build.py`
script.

- For Linux, depending on your distribution you can use `sudo apt-get install`.
  To upgrade your cmake you can see this
  [script](https://github.com/stigmee/doc-internal/blob/master/doc/install_latest_cmake.sh).
- For macOS X you can install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_fr).
- For Windows users you will have to install:
  - Visual Studio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/vs/ (mandatory). Do not forget to
    install Windows SDK (i.e. 10.0.20348.0) in Visual Studio.
  - Python3: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
  - CMake: https://cmake.org/download/
  - Ninja: https://ninja-build.org/
  - Scons: https://scons.org/pages/download.html
  - Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win
  - *Note:* I have installed them for their official website, I did not tried to install them
    from the `winget` command.

To compile GDCef for Windows:
- Ensure VS2022 is installed.
- Open an **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022**, with
  **Administrator** privilege (this should be available in the start menu under
  Visual Studio 2022). This ensures the environment is correctly set to use the
  VS tools.

### Install Python3 packages

Our [build.py](../build.py) script is made in **Python3** to be used for any
operating system (Linux, macOS X, Windows). Please do not use Python 2. Please
install the needed Python packages with pip by typing the following line into a
terminal:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Compilation for Linux and for Windows

**Note concerning Linux user, using GDCEF version < 0.10.0**

For GDCEF version before 0.10.0, once the compilation done, the `libcef.so`
(CEF), `libgdcef.so` (Godot native) and other shared libraries
(`libvulkan.so` ...), as artifacts, are not found by the system (even if
indicated in the .gdnlib file. So for the moment, you have to store the path of
the build in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (for example in your `~/.bashrc` file).

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/your/path/gdcef/examples/build
```

For GDCEF version >= 0.10.0, this issue have been fixed. You no longer need
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. In the case, you were using older version, do not forget to
remove gdcef in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH !

### Compilation of the GDExtension for Godot 3

This module is not compatible with Godot 3. Please go to this branch
[dev-godot-3 branch](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/gdcef/blob/master/addons/gdcef/build.py)
instead.

### Compilation of the GDExtension for Godot < 4.2

This module is probably not compatible with Godot 4.0 and 4.1. Please use Godot >= 4.2.

### Compilation of the GDExtension for Godot >= 4.2

The [build.py](../build.py) does not take arguments for the command line. It
deals with all cases by itself (your operating system, the number of cores of
your CPU ...). By default, it has default versions for Godot and CEF), build in
release mode and use parallelism with OpenMP. First lines of the script is for
user customization. So do not hesitate to modify it.

```
cd addons/gdcef
./build.py
```

Alternative
```
cd addons/gdcef
./build.py
python3 build.py
```

Please be patient! The script needs some time for completing its job since it
has:
- to download CEF from this website https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/index.html
  (+600 MB) and extract the tarball inside `../thirdparty/cef_binary` and
  compile it.
- to git clone [godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) into
  `../thirdparty/godot-4.2` and compile it.
- to compile the [primary CEF process](../gdcef/).
- to compile the  [secondary CEF process](../subprocess/).
- to extract CEF artifacts (*.so *.pak ...) into `build` folder (at the root of
  this repo +1GB of data).

## Update the CEF version

If desired, you can change the CEF version at any moment (even after having
compiled CEF).

- Check this website https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/index.html and select
  your desired operating system.
- Copy the desired CEF version **without the name of the operating system** (for
  example `120.2.4+gc129304+chromium-120.0.6099.199`) and search in
  [build.py](../build.py) script the line `CEF_VERSION=` and paste the
  new version.
- **Be sure your CEF version contains `+` symbols but not the URL-encode `%2B` format.**
- Rerun the `build.py` the older `thirdparty/cef_binary` folder will be replaced
  automatically by the new version.
- Add back the build folder in your project.

## What to do if I dislike the folder name `cef_artifacts` holding CEF artifacts ?

You can change it! Search in [build.py](../build.py) script the line
`CEF_ARTIFACTS_FOLDER = "cef_artifacts"` and modifiy it. Rerun the
`build.py`. This method will force Godot knowing default path. Alternatively,
adapt the code of your gdscript for passing the path (see the API for more
information):

```
$CEF.initialize({"artifacts": "res://cef_artifacts/", ... })
```

## I do not want to compile GDCEF!

There is an option inside the [build.py](../build.py) script. Modify the line:

```
GITHUB_GDCEF_RELEASE = None
```

See https://github.com/Lecrapouille/gdcef/releases to get your desired version
(without 'v' and without godot version). For example:

```
GITHUB_GDCEF_RELEASE = "0.12.0"
```

Drawbacks:
- You can choose the Godot version.
- You can choose the CEF version.

## Debug gdcef

In your gd script, when init CEF. Pass the following settings:

```
$CEF.initialize({"remote_debugging_port": 7777, "remote_allow_origin": "*", ... })
```

Open a Chrome browser and type in the URL: `http://localhost:7777`. You will see something like this:
